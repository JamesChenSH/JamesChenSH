# Hi there, I'm James Chen ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a student at the **Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC)** program at the **University of Toronto**, specializing in Computer Science. My primary interest lies in **Human-in-the-Loop AI applications**, where I explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and human cognition to build systems that leverage the strengths of both human intelligence and machine learning algorithms.
