## About Me

I'm a student at the **Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC)** program at the **University of Toronto**, specializing in Computer Science. My primary interest lies in **Human-in-the-Loop AI applications**, where I explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and human cognition to build systems that leverage the strengths of both human intelligence and machine learning algorithms.

## My Projects
### [Guided Decoder](https://github.com/JamesChenSH/JamesChenSH/blob/main/Projects/GuidedDecoder.md)
A debugger for LLM inference time semantic guidance. Users can manipulate the LLM assistant outputs and ask the LLM to continue generation with updated reasoning logic, instead of relying on user messages for guidance.

### [Audio2Image](https://github.com/JamesChenSH/Audio2Image)
CSC2541 Generative AI course Project. It includes: 1. Experimental Encoder-Decoder Transformer model from scratch as preliminary experiment; 2. A diffusion based Cross-Modal Image generation from sound system by building the SounDiff pipeline that adapts ImageBind by fine-tuning Stable Diffusion 2.1 UnClip model using environmental audio and satellite image dataset.

### [Smardity](https://github.com/JamesChenSH/Smardity)
ETH Smart contract vulnerability detector using a fine tuned CodeBERT model.

### [Frost](https://github.com/JamesChenSH/frost)
Zig Based Deterministic Simulation Testing system implemented on FoundationDB against a similar DST implementation by TigerBeetleDB, and evaluated DST on other key-value databases such as RocksDB.
