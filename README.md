# Hi there, I'm Shaohong Chen 

## About Me

I'm a student at the **Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC)** program at the **University of Toronto**, specializing in Computer Science. My primary interest lies in **Human-in-the-Loop AI applications**, where I explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and human cognition to build systems that leverage the strengths of both human intelligence and machine learning algorithms.

Feel free to reach out or explore my repositories to learn more about my work!
